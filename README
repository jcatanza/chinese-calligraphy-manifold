# Chinese Calligraphy Manifold (Phase 1)

An unsupervised 3D Autoencoder that learns the geometry of Chinese handwriting (Chinese MNIST).

## Features
* **3D Latent Space:** Visualizes 15 distinct character classes in a rotating 3D swarm.
* **Unsupervised Physics:** Uses Variance Expansion + Reconstruction Loss to organize clusters without labels.
* **Morph Engine:** A "Hallucination Mode" that interpolates between characters (e.g., morphing "One" to "Three").
* **Custom Driver:** Handles the `Chinese MNIST` dataset structure from Kaggle.

## Setup
1. Download data from [Kaggle: Chinese MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpreda/chinese-mnist).
2. Extract to `./data` so you have `data/chinese_mnist.csv` and `data/data/input_...jpg`.
3. Run `python main_classifier.py`.

## Controls
* **Left Click:** Select Start Character (Green).
* **Right Click:** Select End Character (Red).
* **Space:** Reset Selection.
* **Mouse Drag:** Rotate 3D View.
